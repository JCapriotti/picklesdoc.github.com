# Getting Started

It's very easy to get started with Pickles.  

- Download a copy of the source code from this repository.  
- Run the 'build-release'.cmd file to build and package the tools.
- Pick the runner you want (Console, NAnt or MSBuild)

See the Pickles.Example project for ideas on how to integrate Pickles into your own project.

There are pre-build download packages as well.
